# CASE STUDIES [CASGASS project][1]

![Small Sacale fishery boat](/docs/figs/ssf_boat.png)

The set of species proposed as case study comprises the following: i) a number of species requested by the [WGHMM][1] (1) including the seabass (*Dicentrarchus labrax*), the gunnar (*Eutrigla gurnardus*), the plaice (*Pleuronectes platessa*), the pollack (*Pollachius pollachius*), the sole (*Solea vulgaris*), and the red mullet (*Mullus surmuletus*); and ii) a list of six other abundant and valuable species including the white seabream (*Diplodus sargus*), the pouting (*Trisopterus luscus*), the ballan wrasse (*Labrus bergylta*), the european conger (*Conger conger*), the undulate ray (*Raja undulata*), and the small-spotted catshark (*Scyliorhinus canicula*).

However, we would like to note that during the kick off meeting (held in Santiago de Compostela on 28th April 2014) we decided to make a few changes in the selected set of species. In particular, we removed *Eutrigla gurnardus* and *Pleuronectes platessa* due to their low rates of captures. Those two species were replaced by two important invertebrates, common octopus (*Octopus vulgaris*) and the common spider crab (*Maja brachydactyla*). In addition,
the European flounder (*Platychis flessus*) was also added to the final list.
