<p>The principal aim of this study is to standardize catch and effort data obtained from observers on commercial fishing vessels for a number of finfish species targeted by the small-scale fishing fleet off the Galician coast (ICES areas IXa and VIIIc). This would allow the development of indices of abundance to be used as inputs for stock assessments. A secondary objective is to investigate the degree of synchronicity among trends in species' abundance in relation to environmental conditions and life history traits.
The proposal builds on various pillars of the current strategic plan of ICES. It specifically seeks for an understanding of the dynamics and structure of key biotic components from an integrated perspective (Goals 1 and 2). It also fosters the use of sound statistical models to analyze new data sets (Goals 4), and provide credible advice for management needs (Goal 3).
ICES Science Fund should support this proposal according to the following reasoning: i) small-scale fisheries have a strong socio-ecological importance for the region and are understudied [1], ii) they are of interest within the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) debate [2], and iii) ICES has manifested the importance of gathering information for species subjected to exploitation in EU coastal waters though not included in management plans yet [3].</p>
